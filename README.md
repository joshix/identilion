# "Identilion"

[Identilion][identilion] is an iOS client for [GNU Social (n√©e Statusnet) federated microblog servers][statusnet]. It is based on [Takuma Mori's NatsuLiphone][ntlniph]. Identilion adds settings to connect to any Twitter-compatible API server, rather than being hardwired to one service.

Identilion is not actively maintained.
